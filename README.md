# CSCI-210---Data-Structures
This is my work for my Data Structures course at Palomar College


This class is a systematic study of data structures, including arrays, stacks, recursion, queues, linear and non-linear linked lists, binary trees, hashing, comparative study of searching and sorting algorithms, graphs, Huffman codes, introductory analysis of algorithms, introduction to the complexity of algorithms including big “O” nota­tion, time and space requirements, and object-oriented design of abstract data types. Focus on object-oriented programming and its principles of objects, classes, encapsulation, inheritance and its relationship to the Java programming language. Includes hands-on laboratory experience reinforcing the lecture material.
